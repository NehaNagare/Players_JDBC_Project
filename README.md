# Players_JDBC_Project
This project is a Java JDBC-based application that performs a SELECT operation on a MySQL database.
It fetches player details from the database and displays them using Java objects.

The project demonstrates how Java connects with a database using JDBC, executes SQL queries, and stores the result in custom model classes.
